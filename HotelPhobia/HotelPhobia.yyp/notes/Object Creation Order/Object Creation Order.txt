Camera sets application surface, so it has to do this before inventory manager gets created, as it
needs the application surface to be set before it can set its GUI variables correctly
This should be alleviated if the initial 'setting' room is used, whereby a nothing room is used at
start to initiate the camera and settings and everything else and then instantly moves on to the main menu

The camera is not dependant on the player existing before it, as it does nothing if it cannot find
the player, but doesn't crash
