-=- Picking Up Items -=-
Picking up items will be defined by the item in the environment, which states what the object is and how
much of it there is. If we do not have the item, the item is pushed to the inventory array. If we do already
have it, the amount is increased by the amount stated by the pickup and no further of the item are pushed
to the array.

-=- Sorting Items -=-
Sorting items will be accomplished by using each item's 'item_type'; a string used to categorise the
different items. The complete array of items within the inventory will be searched through, adding any
items that have a matching 'item_type' to the one being searched for to a new array, which will then be used
to display the sorted items as we would displaying the complete inventory.

-=- Navigating Inventory -=-
If the player holds up or down arrows to navigate through the inventory slots, it will move one slot, as per
key pressed, but a timer will also begin. If the player is still holding down the arrow key by the time the
timer triggers, it will start rapidly moving through the slots, much like a modern ivnentory system does.
